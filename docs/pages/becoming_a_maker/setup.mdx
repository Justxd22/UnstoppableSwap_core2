# Setting up your service

As discussed in the [overview](./overview.mdx), we strongly recommend running the following services along with your `asb`:

- `monerod` (a Monero node)
- `bitcoind` (a Bitcoin node)
- `monero-wallet-rpc` (a Monero wallet RPC server)
- `electrs` (a Bitcoin block explorer)

To make this as easy as possible, we created a [docker compose project](https://github.com/UnstoppableSwap/asb-docker-compose) that will automatically start all the services for you.
