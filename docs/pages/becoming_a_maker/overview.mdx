# An Overview of Becoming a Maker

Makers run an automated swap backend (`asb`), which users can connect to and swap with.
The `asb` accepts Bitcoin and sells Monero, for a fee.

The `asb` needs to communicate with the Bitcoin and Monero blockchains.
For this, it uses `monero-wallet-rpc` (Monero) and `electrs` (Bitcoin).
We strongly recommend also running your own `monerod` and `bitcoind` nodes.
This means that you don't have to rely on third parties for your blockchain data, but it also takes about 1TB of storage.
