# Swapping on Testnet

Swapping on the testnet is a great way to test out the swap functionality without risking your mainnet assets. The testnet is a separate network from the mainnet, and the assets on the testnet are worthless.
To be exact, `testnet3` bitcoin will be swapped for `stagenet` Monero. You will need to set up two wallets to perform a swap:

- A Testnet3 Electrum Wallet (Bitcoin)
- A Stagenet Monero GUI Wallet

## Electrum

Download Electrum from the official [site](https://electrum.org/#download) and then start the wallet in testnet mode.

import { Tabs, Tab } from 'nextra/components'

<Tabs items={['Linux', 'macOS', 'Windows']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    ./electrum --testnet
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    open -n /Applications/Electrum.app --args --testnet
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    If you install Electrum on Windows, you will have two programs you can start. One of them is called "Electrum Testnet".
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

To get some free Testnet coins visit a faucet like [this](https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co) one.

## Monero

If you use the `monero-wallet-cli` you simply need to start it with the `--stagenet` flag. If you use the GUI you can follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5E4aO3UAqJo) tutorial. A list of stagenet remote nodes can be found [here](https://monero.fail/?chain=monero&network=stagenet).

## Launching the GUI

View the [Installation Instructions](../getting_started/install_instructions) if you haven't already installed the GUI. Then start the GUI in testnet mode.

<Tabs items={['Linux', 'macOS']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    ./UnstoppableSwap_*_amd64.AppImage --testnet
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    open -n /Applications/UnstoppableSwap.app --args --testnet
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

From here on you can follow the [Complete your first swap](../usage/first_swap) guide with the difference that you will be using the testnet wallets. The process is the same, but you will be using the testnet wallets instead of the mainnet wallets.
