# Connection Error Handling and Progress Updates Analysis

## Overview

The error message "Trying to reconnect (Last Error: Connection Timeout, 12 times failed, retries_left: 20)" suggests a connection retry mechanism that tracks failed attempts and remaining retries. While this exact format isn't found in the main codebase, several connection handling mechanisms exist.

## Key Connection Handling Components

### 1. Redial Behavior (`swap/src/network/redial.rs`)

The redial behavior implements automatic reconnection with exponential backoff:

```rust
pub struct Behaviour {
    peer: PeerId,
    sleep: Option<Pin<Box<Sleep>>>,
    backoff: ExponentialBackoff,
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- Tracks time until next redial attempt
- Never gives up reconnecting (`max_elapsed_time: None`)
- Logs: `"Waiting for next redial attempt"`

### 2. Event Loop Connection Handling (`swap/src/cli/event_loop.rs`)

**Connection Events Logged:**
- `"Connected to Alice"` - successful connection
- `"Dialing Alice"` - connection attempt
- `"Lost connection to Alice"` - connection failure
- `"Failed to connect to Alice"` - outgoing connection error

**Retry Mechanisms:**
- Uses `backoff::future::retry_notify` for various operations
- Different timeout configurations:
  - `REQUEST_RESPONSE_PROTOCOL_TIMEOUT: 60s`
  - `EXECUTION_SETUP_PROTOCOL_TIMEOUT: 120s`

### 3. GUI Progress Updates (`src-gui/`)

The frontend tracks various connection states and progress:

#### Registry Connection Tracking (`src-gui/src/store/features/makersSlice.ts`)
```typescript
registry: {
  makers: ExtendedMakerStatus[] | null;
  connectionFailsCount: number; // Tracks failed connection attempts
}
```

#### Background Progress Events (`src-gui/src/renderer/background.ts`)
- Listens for various progress events including connection status
- Updates UI based on connection state changes

#### Tor Connection Status (`src-gui/src/store/features/torSlice.ts`)
- Tracks Tor proxy status and bootstrap progress
- Handles connection state for anonymized connections

### 4. Monero Wallet Connection Retry (`swap/src/monero/wallet.rs`)

```rust
for i in 1..=max_attempts {
    tracing::info!(name = %self.main_wallet, attempt=i, "Syncing Monero wallet");
    
    match result {
        Ok(refreshed) => return Ok(refreshed),
        Err(error) => {
            let attempts_left = max_attempts - i;
            tracing::warn!(
                attempt=i, 
                %attempts_left, 
                %error, 
                "Failed to sync Monero wallet"
            );
        }
    }
}
```

## Potential Sources of the Specific Error Message

Given the error format "Trying to reconnect (Last Error: Connection Timeout, 12 times failed, retries_left: 20)", this could originate from:

### 1. Monero Wallet RPC Process
The application downloads and runs external Monero wallet RPC binaries that might generate this message format.

### 2. GUI Translation Layer
The frontend might be formatting backend error messages into user-friendly text.

### 3. External Dependencies
Libraries like libp2p or networking dependencies might generate these messages.

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Enhanced Progress Reporting

**Current State:** Basic logging of retry attempts
**Improvement:** Implement structured progress updates with:
- Current attempt number
- Total attempts made
- Remaining retries (if applicable)
- Last error details
- Estimated time until next retry

### 2. Unified Error Formatting

**Implementation suggestion:**
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ConnectionProgress {
    pub current_attempt: u32,
    pub total_attempts: u32,
    pub retries_left: Option<u32>,
    pub last_error: String,
    pub next_retry_in: Option<Duration>,
}
```

### 3. GUI Progress Indicators

**Current Features:**
- Linear progress bars for known progress
- Circular progress for unknown progress
- Connection status alerts

**Improvements:**
- Show detailed retry information
- Display connection quality metrics
- Provide user control over retry behavior

### 4. Better Error Context

**Current Issues:**
- Generic error messages
- Limited context about connection state
- No user guidance on resolution

**Solutions:**
- Categorize connection errors by type
- Provide actionable suggestions
- Show network diagnostics

## Connection Flow Analysis

### P2P Connection (Alice â†” Bob)
1. Initial dial attempt
2. Connection establishment or failure
3. Redial behavior kicks in on failure
4. Exponential backoff with unlimited retries
5. Progress updates via GUI events

### Monero Node Connection
1. Daemon selection from available nodes
2. Health check with 30s timeout
3. Fallback to next available daemon
4. Wallet RPC process management

### Bitcoin Node Connection
1. Electrum server selection
2. Connection status monitoring
3. Automatic failover between nodes
4. Balance and transaction monitoring

## Diagnostic Information

To better understand the specific error message, check:

1. **Monero wallet RPC logs** - Look for connection retry messages
2. **Tor connection logs** - Check for circuit establishment issues  
3. **GUI console logs** - Look for formatted error messages
4. **System network logs** - Check for underlying network issues

## Configuration Options

### Timeout Settings
- `bitcoin_lock_mempool_timeout`: 10 minutes (mainnet)
- `bitcoin_lock_confirmed_timeout`: 2 hours (mainnet) 
- Monero daemon request timeout: 30 seconds
- Request-response protocol timeout: 60 seconds

### Retry Behavior
- Redial: Unlimited retries with exponential backoff
- Swap setup: Limited by `EXECUTION_SETUP_PROTOCOL_TIMEOUT`
- Encrypted signature: Unlimited retries
- Registry updates: Tracked failure count with threshold

This analysis provides a foundation for understanding and improving the connection error handling and progress update mechanisms in the swap application.
