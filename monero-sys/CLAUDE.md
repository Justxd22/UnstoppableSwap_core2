# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build/Test Commands
- Build: `cargo build`
- Test all: `cargo test`

## Development Notes
- In src/bridge.rs we mirror some functions from monero/src/wallet/api/wallet2_api.h. CXX automatically generates the bindings from the header file.
- When you want to add a new function to the bridge, you need to copy its definition from the monero/src/wallet/api/wallet2_api.h header file into the bridge.rs file, and then add it some wrapping logic in src/lib.rs.

## Code Conventions
- Rust 2021 edition
- Use `unsafe` only for FFI interactions with Monero C++ code
- The cmake build target we need is wallet_api. We need to link libwallet.a and libwallet_api.a.

## Important Development Guidelines
- Always verify method signatures in the Monero C++ headers before adding them to the Rust bridge
- Check wallet2_api.h for the correct function names, parameters, and return types
- When implementing new wrapper functions:
  1. First locate the function in the original C++ header file (wallet2_api.h)
  2. Copy the exact method signature to bridge.rs
  3. Implement the Rust wrapper in lib.rs
  4. Run the build to ensure everything compiles correctly
- Remember that some C++ methods may be overloaded or have different names than expected

## Bridge Architecture

The bridge between Rust and the Monero C++ code works as follows:

1. **CXX Interface (bridge.rs)**:
   - Defines the FFI interface using the `cxx::bridge` macro
   - Declares C++ types and functions that will be accessed from Rust
   - Special considerations in the interface:
     - Static C++ methods are wrapped as free functions in bridge.h
     - String returns use std::unique_ptr to bridge the language boundary

2. **C++ Adapter (bridge.h)**:
   - Contains helper functions to work around CXX limitations
   - Provides wrappers for static methods (like `getWalletManager()`)
   - Handles string returns with `std::unique_ptr<std::string>`

3. **Rust Wrapper (lib.rs)**:
   - Provides idiomatic Rust interfaces to the C++ code
   - Uses wrapper types (WalletManager, Wallet) with safer interfaces
   - Handles memory management and safety concerns:
     - Raw pointers are never exposed to users of the library
     - Implements `Send` and `Sync` for wrapper types
     - Uses `Pin` for C++ objects that require stable memory addresses

4. **Build Process (build.rs)**:
   - Compiles the Monero C++ code with CMake targeting wallet_api
   - Sets up appropriate include paths and library linking
   - Configures CXX to build the bridge between Rust and C++
   - Links numerous static and dynamic libraries required by Monero

5. **Memory Safety Model**:
   - Raw pointers are wrapped in safe Rust types
   - `unsafe` is only used at the FFI boundary
   - Proper deref implementations for wrapper types
   - The `OnceLock` pattern ensures WalletManager is a singleton

6. **Adding New Functionality**:
   1. Find the desired function in wallet2_api.h 
   2. Add its declaration to the `unsafe extern "C++"` block in bridge.rs
   3. Create a corresponding Rust wrapper method in lib.rs
   4. For functions returning strings or with other CXX limitations, add helper functions in bridge.h

This architecture ensures memory safety while providing idiomatic access to the Monero wallet functionality from Rust.
